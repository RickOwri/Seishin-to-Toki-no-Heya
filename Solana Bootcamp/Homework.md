Decentralised Systems
    Consider
    1. Fill in the Sli.do Poll about your goals for this course
    2. Discuss in your teams what a decentralised version of a game like monopoly would be like, if
    there was no software on a central server.
    What are the essential pieces of functionality ?
    How could people cheat ?
    How could you prevent them from cheating ?
    This is just a general discussion, there is no need to write any code or do any design.
    3. Do you feel that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a move towards
    decentralisation? Will they help or hinder adoption of other cryptocurrencies?

2.
What are the essential pieces of functionality ?
- randomness element, die
- money
- choosing what piece to move to leverage money gain
How could people cheat ?
- if the algorithm is not quite random, they would try to manipulate the die
- people can hide money from the pool of money or delete money if needed to win during the game
- if people don't pay attention they can move the piece when other people do not see
How could you prevent them from cheating ?
- inspector monitoring that nobody has cheated, the monitor in a decentralized ecosystem should be 
everybody
- penalities for people that got caught cheating
